• Developed a Machine learning model to predict heart disease, utilizing clinical and demographic parameters and achieving an accuracy
of 87% with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) as the most effective algorithm.
• Conducted data preprocessing and feature selection on the Cleveland database from UCI repository, focusing on 14 key attributes,
including age, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate.
• Implemented and compared multiple algorithms, including KNN, decision trees, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression,
analyzing their performance and providing a comprehensive accuracy-based evaluation.
• Optimized hyperparameters using grid search to enhance model performance, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in early
heart disease detection and preventive healthcare solutions.
